# Support Engineer Hiring Project

Hello! This is the technical screening challenge for our Director, Customer Support role. This is a leadership role, and we don't expect you'll spend very much time at all (or any time!) writing code in your day-to-day job. However, we need to see that you to "get" the technical stuff, so you can understand our customers (who are developers). We do also expect that occasionally, you'll find yourself answering a customer support ticket, and we want to see that you have the skills to do that effectively.

This is the same technical challenge we send out to Support Engineers (the folks on your future team). It's intended to be fast to complete -- we're not looking for perfection, just confirmation that you have some basic tech skills!

## What you should do

For the technical challenge, we want you to do two things with the starter Rails project in this repository:

1. Make it send an email when the button is clicked. 
2. Deploy it to Fly.io

The project is mostly ready to go, it's just missing some functionality. All you need to do is handle the button click, write the code to send an email, and then deploy it.

You do not need to do any special setup to send emails. The project is configured to show a preview in a new tab when an email send is triggered. You don't need to actually send the email, just trigger the preview to simulate sending the email. You've succeeded if your email send trigger launches a new tab with a preview of the email. 

If you've never done Rails before, that's ok! Our customers will use languages you have never experienced before, too. There's plenty of time to figure it out.

## What we care about

Your code does not need to be perfect. We don't want you to waste time on this (we'll have more meaty challenges later on). What we're looking for is:

* the code works, as specified above
* and it's deployed on Fly.io (we can visit your app)
* really, that is it, we promise!

Do not spend time on:

* Making the Rails app look pretty
* Making the code nice
* Code tests

If you've ever written rails before, we expect the challenge to take about 30 minutes. You can spend as long as you need, though, don't stress if you're learning on the fly.

## Submitting your work

We'll invite you to a private GitHub repo based on this template. 

Do all of your work in the `main` branch. Don't bother with PRs, branches, or spend time on tidy commits -- we have software to help us review. Just don't force push over the initial commit or we can't generate a diff of only your work.

When you're ready, let us know, and we'll schedule it for review. Make sure you add the URL to your deployed Rails app!
